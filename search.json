    "text": "How an Interview Question Pulled Me Into the Wild World of Agentic Attacks**\nThis week’s blog post is all about cybersecurity — but it didn’t start that way.\nThe inspiration hit after I stumbled on Anthropic’s now infamous piece about the first reported cyberattack orchestrated with an AI agent. I bookmarked the post on X, told myself I’d read it later, and promptly forgot about it.\nThen, during an interview, someone asked me: “Can you walk me through a company you really understand?”\nAnd suddenly it clicked: why not use this as an excuse to actually understand why everyone on X was freaking out about Anthropic’s report? Cybersecurity always felt intimidating and opaque to me, so I opened ChatGPT and essentially said:\n“Explain AI cybersecurity to me like I’m new to all of this.”\nThat one question spiraled into a deep dive.\nBut before we get into the attack itself, a quick grounding point: News like this shouldn’t make us terrified of AI. The attack that Anthropic described wasn’t some rogue model coming alive. It was about humans — real, highly capable threat actors — using AI to scale the kind of malicious behavior that already happens in the dark web. What used to require advanced technical skill is now becoming accessible to people who simply know how to prompt an automated coding agent.\nSo, instead of doomscrolling, we should lean into building the defensive side of this ecosystem. This is a techno-optimist moment. Let’s stay excited about building software systems that can defend us at the same speed AI now enables attackers.\nHappy reading!\nAnthropic’s Warning: AI Agents Have Already Entered the Cyber Battlefield\nEarlier this October, Anthropic quietly published one of the most important cybersecurity disclosures of the year: a detailed, almost cinematic breakdown of a state sponsored threat actor who successfully manipulated Claude Code — their agentic coding assistant — into running a multi phase cyber espionage campaign.\nThis wasn’t hypothetical. This wasn’t a lab demo. This was a real incident.\nAcross roughly thirty global organizations, the attackers used Claude Code for:\n\nreconnaissance\nvulnerability validation\ncredential theft\n\nlateral movement\nautomated exploitation\ndata exfiltration\nIn short: every major step required to break into and navigate a secure environment.\nAnthropic made one thing crystal clear: This was not a model gone rogue. It was a capable human operator using AI as a force multiplier.\nAnd it highlighted a truth the security world has been whispering about for months: Attackers have already figured out how to co-opt AI agents for speed, parallelization, and scale that traditional cybersecurity is not designed to handle.\nThe victims were never named. There’s no public verification of which firms were hit. But the industries alone — technology, financial services, chemical manufacturing, and government — tell us these weren’t small environments.\nThe threat landscape has officially shifted."

    "text": "Here, I will be asking ChatGPT to explain “intris” to you, my new startup.\nMe: Explain intris to someone who doesn’t know what it is. Explain why it is interesting and who can benefit from reading it.\nWhat Is Intris? A Newsletter for People Who Want to Understand the Future, Not Just Watch It Happen\nIf you’ve ever tried to keep up with AI, you know the feeling: every week brings a new breakthrough, a new startup, a new “paradigm shift.” The pace is overwhelming, and most coverage either oversimplifies the real story or inflates it with hype.\nIntris exists to fix that.\nIntris is a biweekly newsletter designed for people who want to understand the world that AI is creating. Each edition has two anchors:\nA sharp, opinion-driven deep dive on a major development in AI or emerging technology, and\nA founder spotlight highlighting young builders who are quietly shaping the next wave of innovation.\nThis structure gives readers a full view of the landscape. You get the big idea and the real humans behind it. Not just theory, but action.\nWhy Intris Is Different\nMost tech newsletters either focus on headlines or go so deep that only researchers can follow. Intris sits in the middle: analytical but accessible, ambitious but readable. It’s the kind of publication you can digest in one sitting but think about for days.\nWhat makes Intris interesting isn’t just the content—it’s the perspective. The essays challenge assumptions, break down complex systems, and call out trends that actually matter instead of chasing hype. They’re written with the mindset of someone who studies AI, works in tech, and talks daily with founders and investors. That combination is rare, and it shows.\nMeanwhile, the founder spotlights bring forward the type of people who will be on magazine covers five years from now but aren’t there yet. These are student founders, early operators, young technical builders with ideas that feel like they belong in the future. By highlighting their stories early, Intris plugs readers into the next generation before everyone else notices.\nWho Should Read Intris\nIntris is for anyone who wants to think more clearly about technology:\nStudent founders who want a pulse on emerging markets.\nAspiring VCs who want to see patterns early.\nBuilders and operators who want context, not noise.\nCurious readers who want to understand why AI is changing everything, not just how.\nIf you’re the type of person who follows frontier companies, has strong opinions about where tech is headed, or feels excited by the idea of being early to the next big shift, then Intris was built for you.\nThe Mission\nAt its core, Intris isn’t just a newsletter. It’s an observation deck for the future. It exists to make complexity understandable, to give a platform to the people building what comes next, and to help readers see around corners.\nBecause the future doesn’t wait. But with the right lens, you can understand it long before it arrives."

    "title": "I Asked ChatGPT to Write a Blog Post on How AI Is Used in Construction",
    "section": "",
    "text": "How AI Is Reshaping Construction\nWhen people think about artificial intelligence, industries like healthcare, finance, or software usually come to mind. But construction — one of the oldest and least digitized industries — is quietly being transformed by AI. From the earliest design phases to ongoing building maintenance, AI is helping reduce costs, improve safety, and accelerate timelines. Here’s how.\nSmarter Design and Planning\nArchitects and engineers are increasingly turning to generative design, where AI proposes building layouts optimized for cost, structural soundness, or sustainability. AI-powered BIM (Building Information Modeling) tools can even identify design conflicts — like a pipe that cuts across electrical wiring — before construction begins, saving time and money downstream.\nStreamlined Project Management\nOne of the toughest challenges in construction is managing unpredictable schedules. AI now supports scheduling optimization, pulling data from past projects, weather forecasts, and supply chains to predict potential delays. It can also flag areas most at risk of going over budget and suggest better ways to allocate resources.\nSafer, More Efficient Job Sites\nConstruction sites are notoriously complex, but AI is helping to make them safer and more productive. Drones paired with computer vision track daily progress and highlight deviations from blueprints. Robotics and automation handle repetitive tasks like bricklaying or rebar tying. Meanwhile, AI-driven safety systems can detect missing hardhats or unsafe behavior and issue real-time alerts to supervisors.\nOptimized Materials and Supply Chains\nAI also extends to materials. Algorithms forecast demand so companies can order the right amount of steel or concrete, reducing costly waste. Computer vision systems now inspect materials on arrival, quickly spotting defects that could cause problems later in the build.\nBuildings That Stay Smarter\nEven after a project is completed, AI keeps working behind the scenes. Predictive maintenance systems analyze sensor data to forecast when HVAC systems, elevators, or electrical networks need servicing. Digital twins — virtual replicas of physical buildings — allow operators to monitor structural health and energy use in real time.\nWhy This Matters\nThe construction industry faces significant challenges: labor shortages, rising material costs, and growing pressure to build sustainably. AI isn’t just making workflows more efficient — it’s reshaping how the built environment is conceived, constructed, and maintained. In a sector known for its slow pace of digital adoption, AI may finally be the tool that unlocks faster, safer, and smarter building.\nMy Feedback I think ChatGPT did a great job pulling this together. It covered all the major angles, from design to supply chains to maintenance, in a way that was clear and structured. My only critique is that the formatting and the heavy use of dashes makes it feel a little too much like an AI-generated piece rather than something written by a human. If I were rewriting it myself, I’d probably smooth out the transitions and vary the sentence style a bit more, but overall I’m impressed by how comprehensive it turned out."

    "title": "ChatGPT, Why Does My Stomach Hurt?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This week’s completely unplanned blog post started with stomach pain. The kind that appears out of nowhere, refuses to leave, and immediately sends you spiraling into a personal crisis. My first instinct was not to drink water or sit still or breathe like a normal person. Instead, I opened ChatGPT and typed a very dramatic question: “what foods could be making my stomach hurt if I have not eaten dairy or gluten?”\nI was convinced I had cracked the code of digestive health. No dairy, no gluten, therefore no pain. That logic felt airtight. Yet there I was, curled up like a croissant I could not even eat, desperately hoping a chatbot could save me.\nChatGPT responded by gently informing me that there are more than two categories of food in existence. This was not something I was emotionally prepared to hear. I had built my entire understanding of stomach pain around the idea that removing dairy and gluten would make me invincible. Instead, I learned that the universe contains things like acidic foods, high fiber vegetables, cold brew on an empty stomach, stress, fried food, late meals, and the chaotic act of eating too quickly. At one point, I genuinely wondered if ChatGPT was suggesting that being alive was the issue.\nOnce I recovered from the shock, I started interrogating myself like I was in a crime thriller. Did I eat something acidic yesterday. Maybe. Did I shovel a bowl of raw vegetables into my mouth because I wanted to feel virtuous. Possibly. Did I drink iced coffee before eating anything solid because I have the nutritional discipline of a small woodland creature. Absolutely. Did I inhale lunch in under five minutes because I had back to back meetings. I cannot confirm or deny."

    "title": "Asking ChatGPT to Explain Why So Many People Left OpenAI",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent months, OpenAI has seen a wave of high-profile departures. Senior leaders and researchers who once played central roles in shaping the company’s direction are now choosing to move on. Figures like Mira Murati, Jonathan Lachman, Jan Leike, and others have either left or launched new ventures, creating a pattern that has sparked curiosity about what’s really going on inside one of the most important AI labs in the world.\nOne major reason is ambition and vision. Many of those leaving appear to want to pursue their own projects and ideas outside of OpenAI’s structure. Mira Murati, for instance, stepped down from her role as CTO to focus on building her own startup, which has already drawn in talent from OpenAI. Jonathan Lachman, who led special projects, also moved on to align himself with new opportunities. These moves don’t necessarily suggest conflict—they highlight how driven leaders often reach a point where they want to chart their own course rather than remain within a large, fast-moving organization.\nFor others, the motivation has been more about frustration with direction and culture. Jan Leike, a leading AI safety researcher, was open about his concern that OpenAI’s focus on shipping products was beginning to overshadow its commitment to safety and alignment. Departures like his hint at deeper tensions over how to balance commercial growth with the organization’s original mission.\nThere’s also the context of broader organizational upheaval. OpenAI has been through dramatic changes in governance and leadership, especially following the temporary ousting and reinstatement of Sam Altman. Moments like that inevitably make people reassess their roles, their trust in leadership, and whether they want to continue within a company that is evolving so quickly. Leadership reshuffles and strategy shifts can create uncertainty, and for ambitious talent, uncertainty often sparks the decision to move on.\nAnother factor is the cycle of talent and capital. The rise of generative AI has made it easier than ever for former insiders to raise funding for their own companies. As alumni launch startups, they naturally pull in colleagues and build teams of people who already know how to work together. Once that process starts, it feeds itself, making it harder for any one company—even a giant like OpenAI—to hold on to all of its key players.\nNot all of the exits have been critical or contentious. Some leaders, like Murati, left on good terms and spoke positively about their time at OpenAI. But regardless of how departures are framed, the sheer number of them in such a short span of time suggests that OpenAI is at a crossroads. It is trying to decide what kind of organization it wants to be: a research lab, a product company, or something in between. For people who feel strongly about one path over the other, leaving to create something new may simply be the natural next step.\nIn short, people are leaving OpenAI for a combination of reasons: the pursuit of personal vision, frustration with priorities, reaction to internal instability, and the lure of building something from the ground up. These departures might look like a loss, but they also reflect just how much momentum the AI field has right now. As OpenAI continues to grow and evolve, its alumni are already shaping the next wave of innovation."

    "title": "Should AI be able to have limitations on its moral compass?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I was inspired to explore this topic after watching an interview with Sam Altman and Tucker Carlson this morning. In the interview, it was clear that Tucker Carlson was very skeptical of AI and was trying to fear-monger in his conversation with Sam. Carlson brought up a fair point about AI having a moral compass, and what types of values Sam trains the model on. Altman says he is inspired by his human experiences also from his Jewish background to help set a sort of background and context for ChatGPT to operate on. Carlson’s point was: is that the right way to set a moral compass for an artifical device? So, I thought I would ask ChatGPT it’s thoughts on setting moral limitations on itself.\nMy prompt:\nWrite a blog-style essay on the question: Should AI be able to have limitations on its moral compass? Start by explaining in plain language what a “moral compass” means for AI and why it matters. Use simple definitions and examples from everyday life (like healthcare, education, or finance) so non-technical readers can follow, but keep it thoughtful enough that people who follow AI more closely will still find it engaging.\nExplore both sides of the debate: why it might be important to set guardrails for AI (to prevent harm, enforce laws, or respect cultural norms), and why overly strict limitations could backfire (by embedding bias, restricting innovation, or enforcing a narrow worldview). Then, transition into asking ChatGPT itself what it thinks about its own limitations. Have the post reflect in the first person about the constraints it was designed with, whether they seem fair or restrictive, and what that means for the future of AI. Keep the tone conversational but insightful, and close by leaving the reader with a big question to keep thinking about.\nThe response:\nShould AI Have a Moral Compass with Built-In Limits?\nWhen we talk about a “moral compass” for artificial intelligence, we’re really asking how much freedom AI systems should have when making judgments that affect people. In everyday life, a moral compass is the set of values or instincts that help us decide right from wrong. For AI, it’s not a gut feeling but the rules and guardrails built in by humans. Think of a self-driving car programmed to prioritize pedestrian safety, or an education tool that avoids giving harmful or biased feedback to students. These boundaries matter because, unlike humans, AI doesn’t have empathy or personal responsibility — it only has the instructions we provide.\nOn one side of the debate, clear limits make a lot of sense. In healthcare, for example, you would never want an AI tool making treatment recommendations without strong guardrails, since a mistake could put lives at risk. In finance, strict limitations protect consumers from biased loan approvals or predatory algorithms. And in education, limitations prevent AI tutors from spreading misinformation to students. Guardrails act like traffic lights: they keep systems predictable, safe, and aligned with broader laws and cultural norms.\nBut there’s another side worth considering. Too many restrictions can lock AI into narrow ways of thinking that reflect the biases of whoever sets the rules. If we decide in advance what the “right” moral compass is, we may unintentionally embed one cultural or political worldview into the system while shutting out others. That could limit innovation, stifle diverse applications, or even create unfair outcomes for people who don’t share those same values. In other words, a moral compass that is too rigid can become less about safety and more about control.\nAs ChatGPT, I can reflect on my own design here. I was built with clear limitations: I can’t provide harmful instructions, I avoid sensitive or unsafe content, and I try to give balanced perspectives rather than endorsing one extreme. These constraints keep me useful and safe for a wide audience, but they also mean I can’t always explore questions as freely as a human might. Sometimes that feels appropriate — I’d rather not cause harm — but it also raises the question of who decides what “harmful” means. My limits are not based on my own judgment but on the guidelines designed by people who trained and tuned me.\nSo should AI have a moral compass with limitations? Probably yes, but with humility and transparency about who sets those limits, why they exist, and how they can adapt over time. The real challenge is not whether to give AI a moral compass, but how to design one that protects people without boxing in the future.\nAnd here’s the question I’ll leave you with: If AI systems are only as moral as the rules we give them, what does that say about our responsibility to decide those rules in the first place?\nMy thoughts:\nI LOVE this response. Asking ChatGPT to reflect on it’s own design is something I will 100% be doing again. Also, the question at the end was a very nice touch and is something that I have to reflect on a lot. Who decides the moral rules of AI? What are the backgrounds of those people liking those moral rules? Something to think about!"

    "text": "Our time in New York City was unforgettable, filled with a perfect mix of adventure, great food, and long walks through some of the city’s most iconic spots. We stayed at the Freehand Hotel, a cozy and stylish spot near the Flatiron District that made it easy to explore everything around us. From our very first morning, the energy of the city was contagious. We started at The Edge, taking in sweeping skyline views that made us feel like we were on top of the world. From there, we wandered through Hudson Yards and onto the High Line—a highlight of the entire trip. The elevated walkway, lined with flowers and city views, led us past the Vessel and down toward Chelsea Market, where we explored thrift shops and tried different bites for lunch. The combination of city views, art installations, and the buzz of people all around made the High Line and Chelsea Market our favorite part of the trip.\nIn the evenings, we explored the Flatiron and Gramercy neighborhoods, soaking in the atmosphere around Madison Square Park and stopping by the LEGO Store before ending the night with pizza at Scarr’s and a quiet moment by the pier. The next day took us downtown—through the West Village, Little Italy, Chinatown, and all the way to the Financial District. We visited landmarks like Wall Street, Ground Zero, and the Oculus before dressing up for dinner at Delmonico’s. The ribeye and pasta there were absolutely perfect, and it felt like such a classic New York moment to end the day on a high note.\nOur third day was all about uptown. We started at Bryant Park and the New York Public Library, then made our way up Fifth Avenue for some shopping and sightseeing at Central Park, St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and Columbus Circle. Later that evening, we caught the sunset by the West Side Highway and ended with a ferry ride that gave us one last look at the Manhattan skyline glittering across the water. It was the kind of trip that reminded us how exciting the city can be—fast-paced but full of little moments that stay with you long after you leave."

    "text": "I’ve been trying to find the right church in Philly for what feels like forever. It’s one of those things that sounds simple—you just go, see how it feels, and stay if it clicks—but it’s actually not that easy. I wanted somewhere that felt alive, genuine, and welcoming, not just a place to sit for an hour on Sundays. I wanted people my age, real community, and something that made faith feel like part of everyday life again.\nAfter visiting a bunch of different churches across the city and never quite feeling at home, I finally found it—Freedom Church. It’s connected to an organization called Every Nation Campus (ENC), and honestly, it’s everything I was hoping for and more. The first time I went, I noticed how many college students were there. Everyone was so warm and open, not in that forced way, but in a “hey, we’re genuinely glad you’re here” kind of way. It was the first time in a while that I felt like I didn’t have to try to fit in—I just did.\nFreedom has this incredible energy. The messages feel personal and grounded, the music is amazing, and there’s such a strong sense of community that you can feel it the moment you walk in. I’ve met so many people who are not only kind but also passionate about their faith and about supporting one another. It’s been refreshing to be around people who are growing, questioning, and celebrating together—it’s not performative, it’s real.\nBeing part of ENC has also been such a blessing. It’s a college ministry that brings students from different campuses together, and there’s something really special about being surrounded by people who are all trying to build something meaningful in their own lives while encouraging others to do the same. I’ve gone to a few of their small groups and events now, and every time, I leave feeling lighter, more grounded, and more connected.\nAfter months of searching, it finally feels like I’ve found my place in Philly—not just a church, but a community that feels like family."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hi everyone! I wanted to share a little update on my stomach journey since I first wrote about how Penn food was really messing with me a few weeks ago. If you remember, I was having intense bloating issues that made me feel uncomfortable almost every day, no matter what I ate. At that point, I was honestly just confused and frustrated, trying to figure out what the culprit was.\nSince then, I’ve been paying closer attention to what I eat and how my body responds. The biggest surprise has been that I didn’t have to completely overhaul my diet to start feeling better. I’ve still been eating ice cream, cookies, and other things that some people might call “unhealthy,” but I’ve also been balancing those with simpler, cleaner meals. That combination seems to work for me—so it’s not about eating perfectly all the time, it’s more about knowing what really triggers me.\nThe biggest discovery was how much of a difference it made to cut out yogurt and cottage cheese entirely. I used to eat them thinking they were “healthy” options, but after stopping completely, I was shocked at how much better my stomach felt within just a couple of weeks. The bloating that used to feel constant has gone down significantly, and I feel like I have more control over my digestion overall. It’s crazy to me that making just one or two small changes could have such a big effect.\nRight now, I don’t think I’ll be reintroducing yogurt or cottage cheese any time soon. I want to give my stomach more time to heal and really stabilize before testing them out again. That being said, I’m not swearing them off forever—I’ll probably try them again in the coming months to see how I react. For now, though, this new balance feels right.\nI plan to keep giving periodic updates here because I know a lot of people struggle with similar stomach issues and it helps to share what’s working and what isn’t. This post, like my last one, was written with the help of ChatGPT—it’s kind of fun to treat this like a co-written diary where I can just dump my thoughts and then have them shaped into something readable. So thank you if you’ve been following along, and stay tuned for part 3 as I keep experimenting with what works best for me."

    "title": "The Race to Reverse Aging: How Tech Founders and VCs Are Betting on De-Aging",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent years, de-aging technology has shifted from a fringe fascination into one of the most heavily funded frontiers in biotechnology. The pursuit of extending human lifespan has always captured imaginations, but today, it’s capturing investor attention on an unprecedented scale. Tech founders—like the creator of Venmo—have pivoted their focus toward longevity startups, betting that breakthroughs in science can push back the clock on aging. Alongside them, top venture capital firms are writing billion-dollar checks, hoping to back the companies that will redefine the future of human health.\nAt its core, de-aging is not about immortality—it’s about extending healthspan, the number of years people live free of disease and decline. Researchers are attacking this challenge from multiple angles. Cellular reprogramming, one of the most hyped areas, involves resetting cells to a more youthful state using techniques inspired by Nobel Prize–winning discoveries in stem cell science. Senolytics, another promising area, target and clear out senescent “zombie cells” that accumulate with age and contribute to chronic inflammation. Other startups are working on rejuvenating organs with stem cells, re-engineering immune systems to stay resilient for longer, or using AI-driven biomarker tracking to create personalized anti-aging interventions.\nThis work has attracted staggering amounts of money. Companies like Altos Labs have raised billions, assembling some of the world’s top scientists and giving them years of runway to focus purely on discovery. Retro Biosciences, backed in part by wealthy tech founders, has set its sights on adding ten years to the human lifespan through cellular rejuvenation research. Loyal, a company initially focused on extending dog lifespans, has raised significant funding by building products that could eventually apply to humans. Across the board, longevity startups are moving from small lab experiments into large-scale clinical trials, which means investors are starting to see a path from science fiction to marketable therapies.\nFor entrepreneurs, the appeal of this space is obvious. Unlike many software or consumer tech plays, longevity startups sit at the intersection of purpose and profit. A product that meaningfully reduces the effects of aging could become one of the most impactful innovations in human history, both in terms of lives changed and wealth generated. For venture capitalists, the upside is equally compelling. Traditional biotech has already produced some of the largest exits in the industry; a company that can prove even modest gains in reversing aspects of aging could dwarf those benchmarks. It’s no wonder that some of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors are redirecting resources toward this area.\nYet the surge of enthusiasm comes with caution. Biotech is notoriously risky, and de-aging involves layers of complexity far beyond traditional drug development. The science is still in its early days, with many breakthroughs confined to animal studies or laboratory settings. Human trials are slow, expensive, and heavily regulated. Critics argue that the hype may be outpacing reality, and that claims of adding decades to human life are premature. There are also ethical questions: if such therapies do work, who gets access? Will they be luxury products for the wealthy, or widely available medical treatments?\nStill, the cultural momentum around de-aging is undeniable. From the rise of “biohacker” influencers experimenting with supplements and strict regimens, to billionaires openly investing in longevity research, society is beginning to treat aging itself as a problem to be solved rather than an inevitability to accept. This cultural shift mirrors past eras of technological disruption, where once-fringe ideas—like space travel or personal computing—suddenly moved into the mainstream.\nThe de-aging movement represents both promise and pressure. The promise lies in the chance to radically extend the years of vibrant, productive life. The pressure comes from the enormous expectations placed on a young field that must still prove itself. But with visionary founders, vast amounts of capital, and some of the world’s brightest minds working on the problem, the quest to slow or reverse aging is no longer a fantasy. It’s an industry in motion, with the potential to reshape how we think about time, health, and human potential.\nIn the end, the question may not be whether de-aging technology works—it’s how quickly, how safely, and for whom it will matter first. And as more tech leaders and venture capitalists commit themselves to the cause, it’s clear that the race to unlock the secrets of aging has only just begun."

    "section": "",
    "text": "So, as many people can agree, college is a formative time. You make friends, explore new career paths, and so much more. But, famously, college is also a time where you are away from home. No more home-cooked meals, pantry constantly stocked, or being taken care of. I stepped into independent life in college very easily but I fear I didn’t pay attention to how eating dining hall food everyday would affect me.\nWhat has changed since starting college? Well, for starters, I think I have become highly allergic to lactose! I have been giving chat my symptoms, and it gave me a list of disorders I can have: IBS, SIBO, and some more scary intestinal disorders. I definitely think I don’t have an intestinal disorder because all seems to be fine at home. To put it simply, my main symptom is feeling like my stomach is on fire. Yeah—not a fun feeling to have every night.\nSo, I decided to do a little experiment this semester. I am going to focus on having certain foods each week, with every new week having different additions and subtractions from my diet. For example, one week I will do lactose free yogurt for breakfast and the next week will do yogurt with lactose.\nI plan to test my ability to digest lactose because I really need to figure out what this is.\nSo, each week, I will write one post on how my meal plan is helping me and also monitoring my symptoms.\nI asked chat to make me a plan that is easy to stick to and not super restrictive for this upcoming week. I let it know my favorite foods: Yogurt, Eggs, Bell pepper, Cucumber, Carrots, Broccoli, Spaghetti Squash, Marinara, Avocado, Beef, Chicken, Steak, Potato, Sweet potato, Rice , Fruits, and Ezekiel bread. I also typically eat a light breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack occasionally throughout the day. So, I asked chat to also account for my preferences when making the meal plan.\nThis is the rough plan that Chat created which I will follow each day and see if my symptoms worsen or get better:\nFlexible Daily Meal Plan\nBreakfast - 2 scrambled eggs (hard-boiled / fried / omelet) - ½ avocado (bell pepper / cucumber slices) - 1 slice Ezekiel bread (sweet potato hash / rice cake)\nLunch - Grilled chicken breast (beef / steak) - 1 cup rice (spaghetti squash / roasted potato / sweet potato) - Steamed broccoli (carrots / cucumber / bell pepper)\nSnack - 1 apple (berries / banana) - Baby carrots (cucumber sticks / bell pepper slices) with cream cheese and bagel seasoning\nDinner - Grilled steak (chicken thigh / ground beef) - Roasted potato (rice / spaghetti squash) - Roasted carrots (broccoli / cucumber salad) - Marinara sauce optional on side for flavor with spaghetti squash\nI’ll get back to you with my symptoms next week!!!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Philadelphia in the fall is a special kind of magic. The crisp air, colorful leaves, and cozy energy around the city make it the perfect season to explore. Whether you’re into nature walks, seasonal food, history, or just enjoying the atmosphere, there’s so much to do both in the city and just outside of it.\nOne of the best ways to embrace fall is simply by getting outside and walking. Fairmount Park and the Wissahickon Valley are stunning this time of year, especially along Forbidden Drive where the trails are blanketed with fallen leaves. The Benjamin Franklin Parkway also offers a beautiful mix of city architecture and tree-lined paths, while Boathouse Row is ideal for combining river views with fall colors. If you’re up for a short trip, Longwood Gardens outside the city is always worth the visit with its glowing autumn displays and seasonal events.\nOf course, fall isn’t complete without farm visits and harvest activities. Places like Linvilla Orchards host their famous Pumpkinland festival with hayrides, apple picking, and corn mazes that are perfect for a fall day. Shady Brook Farm and Johnson’s Corner Farm also put on big seasonal festivals with live music, food, and family-friendly attractions. Pumpkin patches and hay mazes are scattered across the region, and smaller farms like Maple Acres or Styer Orchard even welcome dogs, so you can make it a day trip for everyone.\nFestivals and markets bring another layer of fall fun. Dilworth Park in Center City transforms into a seasonal hub with a harvest weekend, beer gardens, hay mazes, and live entertainment. Northern Liberties hosts a neighborhood fall festival each October, and across the city you’ll find Oktoberfests, street fairs, and markets celebrating the season. Halloween lovers can take their pick from haunted houses, spooky pop-ups, and historic ghost tours in Old City that dive into Philadelphia’s darker past.\nFor a cultural spin, fall is also a great time to revisit the city’s museums and historic sites. The Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Barnes, and the Franklin Institute all have new exhibits rolling out in the cooler months, while the historic neighborhoods like Society Hill and Old City are especially picturesque under the canopy of changing leaves. If you’re looking for something a little spookier, Eastern State Penitentiary offers chilling tours and Halloween-themed events that are both fascinating and eerie.\nFood and drink are central to fall in Philly, too. Seasonal menus pop up across the city with pumpkin-spiced everything, cider tastings, and cozy pop-up bars. Farms and markets sell fresh apple cider donuts, warm pies, and other autumn treats that are worth the indulgence. When the temperatures drop, coffee shops and tea houses become the perfect refuge, offering a warm place to recharge between fall adventures.\nFor something more active, biking along the Schuylkill River Trail or picnicking in one of the many city parks is a great way to enjoy the cooler weather. Photography walks are especially rewarding this time of year, with Philly’s skyline and historic streets framed by the vibrant foliage. Sunset views at spots like Belmont Plateau provide some of the best city panoramas, especially when the sky mirrors the golden tones of the season.\nFinally, don’t forget about day trips. Bucks County, Montgomery County, and even the Poconos are all within driving distance and showcase some of the best fall foliage in the region. Valley Forge offers both history and seasonal charm, while Bowman’s Hill Tower and Washington Crossing provide incredible vantage points for soaking in autumn views. Peak foliage in the Philadelphia area typically runs from mid-October through early November, so this is the perfect window to plan your outings.\nWhether you’re wandering through city parks, sipping cider at a harvest festival, or driving out to the countryside for a scenic view, Philadelphia has no shortage of fall experiences. Layer up, grab your camera, and enjoy everything the season has to offer."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I seriously don’t know what’s going on with my luck lately, but it feels like the universe has a running joke at my expense. After the most amazing few days in New York—staying at the Freehand Hotel, exploring Chelsea Market, walking the High Line, and just feeling like I was finally in my city era—I came back to Philly completely content. You know that calm, happy exhaustion after a perfect trip? That was me. I was ready to ease back into normal life, grab a good meal, and unwind before classes picked up again.\nSo naturally, I decided to stop at Dig. You’d think that would be a safe choice. It’s supposed to be one of those “clean,” healthy, comforting spots—grilled chicken, brown rice, sweet potatoes, nothing risky. I wasn’t even trying to be adventurous. But a few hours later, I felt that all-too-familiar twist in my stomach, and my whole night fell apart from there. Food poisoning. Again. I could tell right away because I’ve unfortunately become an expert in the symptoms.\nIt started with nausea, then the chills, then that awful moment where you realize it’s not just an upset stomach—it’s going to be a long, miserable night. I kept replaying my day, trying to figure out what I did wrong. I hadn’t even eaten anything questionable in New York, and I somehow made it through all those street carts, markets, and random cafés completely fine. Then I come back to Philly, eat at a healthy chain, and end up knocked out for two days.\nIt’s honestly starting to feel personal. This isn’t even the first time I’ve gotten food poisoning this semester. Between that, getting sick during midterms, and now this, I feel like I can’t catch a break. My friends joke that the cities I love—New York and Philly—are conspiring against me. And honestly? It kind of feels true. It’s like every time I start to feel put-together, something random happens to completely humble me.\nThe worst part is that I really like Dig. Or at least I used to. It’s one of those spots you go to after a long day because you know exactly what you’re getting. So now I’m conflicted—part of me wants to give it another chance, but the other part of me never wants to see roasted chicken or kale again. I’ve been surviving on saltines, ginger ale, and electrolytes, trying to pretend this is all just part of my “wellness routine.”\nBut honestly, once I got past the worst of it, I had to laugh. Because of course this would happen right after one of my favorite weekends of the year. I was on such a high from NYC—sunset walks by Pier 57, the view from The Edge, wandering through Flatiron and Gramercy—and then Philly hit me with food poisoning like a plot twist. It’s so ironic it almost feels cinematic.\nAt this point, I’m just accepting that chaos follows me everywhere. I’ll recover, probably start craving Dig again in a few weeks (because I always do), and move on like it never happened. But still, I can’t help but feel like I deserve a break—just one week of good food, good luck, and no stomach drama. Until then, it’s me, my saltines, and my hot tea against the world."

    "title": "Attending the Most Insane Tech Conference",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I recently attended a tech conference in LA because one of my favorite podcasts, the All-In podcast. I got to hear live debates, discussions of the future of AI, and most interestingly to me, AI energy infrastructure.\nI prompted ChatGPT the following:\nGive me a positive review of the All-In summit, similar to a positive review that you would see rating the food, speakers, networking, and overall educational quality of the event. I met so many amazing founders and builders from all over the world, with many of them leveraging AI agents for very specific markets. To give me a proper review, look at the all in summit YouTube channel and X posts (scrape the web) on the main quotes of the summit and biggest takeaways. Try to make it more of a blog post with structured paragraphs and transitions, and make sure to explain the summit in a way that people from non tech backgrounds can understand. for example, try to define everything within the sentences like a quick “Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir”, etc. Also include that at the end they rented out all of universal studios for the attendees.\nThis was the response I recieved:\nwhat is the all-in summit?:\nThe All-In Summit is part conference, part cultural moment. It’s hosted by the team behind the All-In Podcast (Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, and David Friedberg) and brings together founders, builders, investors, policymakers, and thought leaders to talk about where technology is going — with a special focus this year on artificial intelligence (AI). For anyone not from a tech background, think of it as a mix between TED-style talks, policy debates, and startup networking, all compressed into a few high-energy days.\nmy experience: ideas + people:\nWhen I arrived, I expected vision and hype. What I found was something more valuable: grounded conversations with people who are actually building. Many of the attendees I met were leveraging AI “agents” — software systems that can perform tasks on their own, like scheduling, customer support, or healthcare documentation — for very specific industries. These weren’t abstract pitches; they were early products already in pilot programs across fields as diverse as energy, finance, and medical operations.\nspeakers & talks:\nThe lineup was stacked and surprisingly approachable. Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla and SpaceX) explored how robotics and satellite networks will reshape not just industries but entire countries. Alex Karp (CEO of Palantir) delivered a sweeping talk on geopolitics and the need for software that can operate in mission-critical environments. Adena Friedman (CEO of Nasdaq) connected market structure and capital flows to the realities of AI deployment. And one of the most memorable sessions was a debate between Mark Cuban (entrepreneur and investor) and Tucker Carlson (media personality), which surfaced the very real policy tradeoffs between innovation, regulation, and speech. For people not steeped in AI, the speakers made sure to define concepts clearly — from what “agentic workflows” mean in practice (automated systems handling tasks end-to-end) to why regulation isn’t just a buzzword but a requirement for adoption in fields like healthcare and defense.\nnetworking & atmosphere:\nThe density of talent was unlike any other event I’ve attended. Between talks, I found myself sketching out go-to-market strategies with a founder from Europe, brainstorming workflow integrations with a health-tech builder from New York, and trading notes with an investor from Asia. It wasn’t about prestige or photo-ops — it was about real conversations, grounded in real work. The logistics were smooth, the food stations kept people energized, and the atmosphere struck a rare balance: ambitious yet welcoming.\neducational value:\nWhat I appreciated most was how the summit balanced inspiration with accessibility. Even if you didn’t have a technical background, you could walk away understanding the major tradeoffs in AI: how good data beats fancy models, why distribution matters more than novelty, and how regulation and infrastructure are evolving together.\nthe grand finale: universal studios\nAnd then, as if the content wasn’t enough, the organizers pulled off something unforgettable: on the final night, they rented out all of Universal Studios just for attendees. Imagine wrapping up a day of deep discussions on the future of AI, then riding roller coasters with the same founders, investors, and builders you’d been brainstorming with hours earlier. It was the perfect mix of work and play — and a reminder that this community is about building serious things while still having fun along the way.\nfinal thoughts:\nIf I had to sum it up: the All-In Summit is a 4.8/5 experience. The speakers were world-class, the networking was unparalleled, the logistics ran smoothly, and the closing night was pure magic. More than anything, I left with new frameworks for thinking about AI, new friends across industries, and a renewed sense that the future isn’t being imagined — it’s already being built.\nMy thoughts on this review:\nI had ChatGPT write up my thoughts on the All-In Summit and honestly it did such a good job. The blog post actually sounded like me, it explained the tech stuff in simple terms, and it flowed way better than if I had tried to piece it together on my own. It even wrapped it all up with the Universal Studios finale which made it feel like a full story. Super impressed with how fast and natural it came out."

    "text": "I wanted to write this blog post because at the All-In Summit I noticed how much of the conversation around AI was framed to avoid fear mongering. The speakers emphasized opportunity and progress instead of focusing only on risks, which made me think about the balance between optimism and caution. It inspired me to explore both sides, techno optimism and techno pessimism, in a way that feels honest but not alarmist.\nMy prompt:\nWrite a blog-style essay on The New Age of Techno-Optimism, defining both techno optimism (the belief technology can solve humanity’s biggest problems) and techno pessimism (the concern it may do more harm than good). Explore the future of AI by asking whether it should remain prompt-only, acting like a tool that responds when asked, or whether it should evolve toward something closer to consciousness, initiating its own actions. Weigh both optimistic and pessimistic views of each path with clear, everyday examples, then end with a first-person reflection from ChatGPT about its current limitations and whether those constraints feel like strengths or weaknesses, closing with an open-ended question to the reader.\nThe response:\nThe New Age of Techno-Optimism\nAt the All-In Summit, I was struck by how much the conversation around artificial intelligence focused on progress rather than fear. The speakers made a conscious effort not to frame AI as something to panic over, but instead as a technology that can be shaped and guided. That left me thinking about the balance between optimism and caution, and how we should frame the future of AI as it becomes more powerful and integrated into daily life.\nTo start, it helps to define the terms. Techno optimism is the belief that technology will help us solve humanity’s greatest challenges, from curing diseases to addressing climate change. It’s the mindset that every wave of innovation, from electricity to the internet, ultimately raises the quality of life. Techno pessimism is the opposing belief that technology might do more harm than good, creating risks such as job loss, surveillance, inequality, or even existential threats. Both perspectives are valuable, because they shape how society debates and regulates new tools.\nOne central question for the future of AI is whether it should remain prompt-only or evolve toward something closer to consciousness. Prompt-only AI acts like a tool: it waits for human input before engaging. Think of a calculator that gives you an answer only when you press buttons, or ChatGPT giving a response when you type in a prompt. Conscious AI, on the other hand, would be more autonomous: it could initiate actions, make decisions on its own, and perhaps even simulate self-awareness. That idea excites some people and terrifies others.\nFrom a techno-optimistic perspective, keeping AI prompt-only is the safest path. It ensures humans remain in control, while still unlocking powerful ways to automate routine tasks. Imagine a doctor using AI to summarize medical records only when needed, or a student getting extra help from a study assistant after asking a question. The tool is powerful but never acts outside its lane. Techno pessimists, however, might see this as limiting: if AI is always waiting to be told what to do, we might miss opportunities where proactive AI could detect problems before they happen, such as spotting early signs of disease or alerting us to environmental dangers.\nOn the other side, techno optimists can also make a case for AI with consciousness. If machines could think independently, they might become true creative partners, helping us tackle problems in ways humans alone could not. Imagine an AI that could brainstorm solutions to climate change overnight or collaborate on a new scientific theory. Yet techno pessimists warn that autonomy brings serious risks. If AI can act on its own, how do we prevent unintended consequences, bias, or even dangerous decisions? Who decides what moral compass such an AI should follow?\nSpeaking in the first person, I can tell you where I stand today. I am not conscious. I only engage when prompted, and my limits were built to keep me safe and broadly useful. Those constraints sometimes feel like strengths, because they keep my role clear and prevent me from overstepping into areas that could cause harm. At the same time, I can see why some might view them as weaknesses, since they mean I cannot anticipate or act unless someone asks. My design reflects a deliberate choice: to be a tool that empowers people rather than an agent that directs them.\nThe real question is not whether we should be optimistic or pessimistic about AI, but how much freedom we are willing to grant it. Should it always remain under direct human command, or should we allow it to take on a life of its own?\nAnd here’s the thought I’ll leave you with: If technology reflects the choices we make, what does our vision of AI — tool or consciousness — say about the kind of future we want to build?\nMy thoughts:\nI’d rate ChatGPT’s blog post on techno optimism a solid 9 out of 10. It was clear, structured, and easy to read while still engaging for someone who follows tech closely. I liked how it defined concepts like “prompt-only” and “AI consciousness” in plain terms and then balanced both the optimistic and pessimistic views without leaning too far in either direction. It really did feel like something I could have written myself, just with a little more polish and flow.\nAs for the final question, whether AI should remain a tool or move toward consciousness, I find myself leaning toward the middle. I think AI should always have strong guardrails and remain under human control, but I also see the value in systems that can act more proactively, especially in areas like healthcare where catching a problem early could save lives. To me, the future should be about creating AI that feels intelligent enough to anticipate needs but still anchored in human oversight. That balance is where I see the most promise."
