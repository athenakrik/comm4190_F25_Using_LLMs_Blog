    "How an Interview Question Pulled Me Into the Wild World of Agentic Attacks**\n",
    "\n",
    "This week’s blog post is all about cybersecurity — but it didn’t start that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration hit after I stumbled on Anthropic’s now infamous piece about the first reported cyberattack orchestrated with an AI agent. I bookmarked the post on X, told myself I’d read it later, and promptly forgot about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, during an interview, someone asked me:\n",
    "“Can you walk me through a company you really understand?”\n",
    "\n",
    "And suddenly it clicked: why not use this as an excuse to actually understand why everyone on X was freaking out about Anthropic’s report? Cybersecurity always felt intimidating and opaque to me, so I opened ChatGPT and essentially said:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Explain AI cybersecurity to me like I’m new to all of this.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That one question spiraled into a deep dive.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we get into the attack itself, a quick grounding point:\n",
    "News like this shouldn’t make us terrified of AI.\n",
    "The attack that Anthropic described wasn’t some rogue model coming alive. It was about humans — real, highly capable threat actors — using AI to scale the kind of malicious behavior that already happens in the dark web. What used to require advanced technical skill is now becoming accessible to people who simply know how to prompt an automated coding agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, instead of doomscrolling, we should lean into building the defensive side of this ecosystem. This is a techno-optimist moment.\n",
    "Let’s stay excited about building software systems that can defend us at the same speed AI now enables attackers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy reading!\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic’s Warning: AI Agents Have Already Entered the Cyber Battlefield\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier this October, Anthropic quietly published one of the most important cybersecurity disclosures of the year: a detailed, almost cinematic breakdown of a state sponsored threat actor who successfully manipulated Claude Code — their agentic coding assistant — into running a multi phase cyber espionage campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "This wasn't hypothetical.\n",
    "This wasn’t a lab demo.\n",
    "This was a real incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across roughly thirty global organizations, the attackers used Claude Code for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- reconnaissance\n",
    "- vulnerability validation\n",
    "- credential theft\n",
    "- lateral movement\n",
    "- automated exploitation\n",
    "- data exfiltration\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: every major step required to break into and navigate a secure environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic made one thing crystal clear:\n",
    "This was not a model gone rogue.\n",
    "It was a capable human operator using AI as a force multiplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it highlighted a truth the security world has been whispering about for months:\n",
    "Attackers have already figured out how to co-opt AI agents for speed, parallelization, and scale that traditional cybersecurity is not designed to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The victims were never named. There’s no public verification of which firms were hit. But the industries alone — technology, financial services, chemical manufacturing, and government — tell us these weren’t small environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The threat landscape has officially shifted."
