    "One of the bold claims in Why Machines Learn is that data often matters more than clever algorithms. The authors argue that larger datasets allow even simple models to outperform sophisticated architectures that have limited examples to learn from. They show this with clear mathematical reasoning and historical case studies, especially from the ImageNet era.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the more I read, the more I kept thinking about my own work with datasets. I agree that scale matters, but I am not convinced that quantity is the true limiting factor anymore. At least in the worlds I follow, the real bottleneck feels like data quality. A massive dataset with unclear labeling or hidden bias is a trap. You get clean curves in the training loop, but your model behaves unpredictably in the wild. I see this constantly in healthtech, where the model can look brilliant in the lab but fails on real patients because the underlying data distributions are inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book’s argument made me reevaluate the current AI ecosystem. Everyone is chasing bigger datasets, but I keep wondering how many teams are thinking deeply about whether their data is actually structured in a way that supports useful generalization. If anything, Why Machines Learn convinced me that careful data design is as important as model design. Bigger is not always better. Better is better."
