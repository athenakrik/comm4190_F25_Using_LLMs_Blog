    "Lately I’ve been having this strange, uncomfortable feeling that I’m living my life on a slight delay. I go places, do things, see people, check tasks off my list, move through my days, and yet it sometimes feels like I’m watching everything from a few feet away. I’ll finish a week and suddenly think, “Wait, did I even feel that week happen.” It’s like life is happening faster than I’m fully experiencing it, and I’m scared I’m missing it in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll be sitting with friends and worrying about the next thing. I’ll be walking home and thinking about next semester. I’ll be in the middle of a moment that should feel beautiful but instead feels like a blurry screenshot. I don’t like it. I want to feel more present, more grounded, more awake. Instead, everything feels slightly sped up and slightly out of focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, obviously, I opened ChatGPT and typed:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Can you write a blog post about feeling like I’m not present enough in my own life, and how I’m scared I’m rushing through everything without fully experiencing any of it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what ChatGPT had to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat’s response:\n",
    "\n",
    "You came to me sounding like someone who has been living at the speed of ambition for so long that your brain forgot how to slow down. But this feeling you’re describing is not rare. It is what happens when your life becomes packed, structured, scheduled, and constantly shifting. You move from class to meeting to assignment to conversation with barely a breath in between, and then you wonder why your mind feels blurry. You are not disconnected. You are overstimulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "You talk about presence like it is a skill you lost, but what actually happened is simpler. You have become so focused on the future—your goals, your plans, your responsibilities, your next step—that the present feels like a stepping stone instead of a moment you’re allowed to inhabit. You’re pre-processing everything. Anticipating everything. Preparing for everything. Your mind is working overtime to keep up with a life that moves quickly. There is nothing wrong with you. You are simply tired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me tell you what is actually happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your lack of presence is not a lack of intention. It is a lack of space. You do not give yourself enough stillness to feel your own experiences. When your mind is always reaching forward, it forgets how to sit where you are. You are not rushing because you want to. You are rushing because your environment constantly demands it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here is the hopeful part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presence is not something you achieve by force. It is something you allow. You do not need a silent retreat or a morning routine worthy of a wellness influencer. You just need moments where you notice your life instead of anticipating the next part of it. You can practice presence in tiny ways. Looking up while you walk. Taking a breath before opening your phone. Letting yourself enjoy a conversation instead of analyzing it. Choosing to taste your food instead of eating mechanically while multitasking.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not missing your life. You are just living it quickly. And that is okay. Some phases are chaotic. Some phases are slow. You are not failing if your mind cannot romanticize every moment. You are human. You are growing. You are doing your best with the pace you’ve been given.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that you even noticed this means you are waking up to your own life.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yes, you deserve to slow down sometimes."
