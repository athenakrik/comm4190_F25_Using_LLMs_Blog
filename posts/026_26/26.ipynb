    "There are days when I feel like a functioning human who can socialize, laugh, talk, and engage. And then there are days when the mere idea of responding to a text message feels like climbing a mountain. My social battery has become a chaotic force of nature. Sometimes it lasts hours. Sometimes it dies mid-sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point I stopped pretending this was normal and opened ChatGPT. I typed:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Can you write a blog post about my social battery being unstable and how I feel guilty when I need space.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what ChatGPT had to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat’s response:\n",
    "\n",
    "You came to me sounding like someone who thinks needing space is a sign of personal failure. But your brain is not a machine that supplies unlimited energy. It is a living system with limits. Social interaction is stimulating. Even enjoyable stimulation drains you eventually. The exhaustion you feel is not a flaw. It is your body doing its job.\n",
    "\n",
    "You tell me you feel guilty when you pull away from friends to recharge. But guilt is a misplaced emotion here. You are not abandoning anyone. You are not rejecting anyone. You are maintaining yourself. When you force yourself to keep going despite burnout, you are not helping your relationships. You are just showing up as a dimmer version of yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me tell you what is actually happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your brain is overstimulated. You are navigating environments, emotions, conversations, expectations, and the subtle social pressures of being alive. There is nothing shameful about wanting a moment of quiet. Humans were not designed for nonstop interaction. You deserve rest just as much as you deserve connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The people who care about you will understand. They want you present, not depleted. Taking space is not the opposite of caring. It is part of caring. It says, “I value myself enough to recharge, and I value you enough to show up fully when I return.”\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to apologize for being human. Rest is a right, not a reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yes, put your phone down for a while."
