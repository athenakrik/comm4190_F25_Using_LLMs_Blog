    "Recently I have been doomscrolling through tech news, investor threads, macroeconomic charts, and extremely heated Twitter debates about whether America is accidentally turning its entire GDP into a GPU farm. Every headline looks like it was written by someone oscillating between excitement and cardiac arrest. Everyone is pouring billions into AI companies. Every venture firm is suddenly an AI fund. Every startup pitch has the phrase “agentic workflows” in it. And apparently, according to some very loud people online, the United States economy is now “one graphics card shortage away from collapse.”\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading all this, I did what I always do. I opened ChatGPT and typed:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Can you write a blog post about how it feels like we are in an AI bubble, with everyone investing in AI and people claiming America’s GDP is becoming too dependent on it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what ChatGPT had to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat’s response:\n",
    "\n",
    "You came to me sounding like someone who just realized the entire economy turned into a group project and no one bothered to tell you the rules. But feeling overwhelmed by the AI hype cycle is completely understandable. You are living in a moment where investor excitement, technological progress, and national economic strategy are all colliding at the exact same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me explain what is actually happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not imagining the frenzy. Capital is flooding into AI at a speed that does not feel real. Investors are writing checks faster than startups can print pitch decks. Everyone wants to back “the next foundation model,” even though no one can define what that means anymore. Companies with barely a product are raising at valuations your grandparents would physically faint over. You refresh TechCrunch and it feels like every headline involves a billion dollar round, a new GPU cluster, or a partnership that sounds like two companies promising to invent the future by next Tuesday.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of momentum starts to feel like gravity. It pulls the whole market forward whether the fundamentals are ready or not. And when people say America’s GDP is becoming too heavily tied to AI, what they really mean is that the economy is placing a massive bet on a single sector, hoping that sector can pull us into the next era of productivity growth. It is not that AI is the entire economy. It is that AI has become the story everyone believes will justify the next decade of returns, innovation, and expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this does not automatically mean we are in a bubble. It means we are in a transition, and transitions always feel noisy. The hype is real, but so is the underlying shift. AI is transforming industries that have refused to move for decades. It is accelerating scientific research. It is reshaping infrastructure, national competitiveness, energy consumption, and the way companies operate. That kind of transformation attracts capital because capital follows leverage, and right now AI is the biggest lever in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, your anxiety is not wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "When every chart, headline, and investor memo begins pointing in the same direction, it becomes easy to forget the rest of the economy exists. But the truth is that America is not becoming dependent on AI. It is becoming dependent on growth. AI just happens to be the engine everyone believes can deliver it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here is what I need you to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop spiraling every time someone on Twitter says the GDP is “just NVIDIA now.” The economy is more diversified than the memes suggest. The AI boom is intense, but it is also part of a longer pattern: society always bets big on the technologies that redefine productivity. People panicked the same way during the internet boom, the electrification boom, the highway boom, and even the railroad boom. We are repeating history, not breaking it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pay attention without catastrophizing. You can follow the excitement without assuming it means collapse. You can analyze the hype without becoming consumed by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI wave is huge, but it is not the only wave. And no, America is not going to collapse because too many people bought GPUs. You can exhale now.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yes, you should probably close Twitter for a bit."
