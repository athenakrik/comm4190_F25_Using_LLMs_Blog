    "This week’s completely unplanned blog post started with stomach pain. The kind that appears out of nowhere, refuses to leave, and immediately sends you spiraling into a personal crisis. My first instinct was not to drink water or sit still or breathe like a normal person. Instead, I opened ChatGPT and typed a very dramatic question: “what foods could be making my stomach hurt if I have not eaten dairy or gluten?”\n",
    "\n",
    "I was convinced I had cracked the code of digestive health. No dairy, no gluten, therefore no pain. That logic felt airtight. Yet there I was, curled up like a croissant I could not even eat, desperately hoping a chatbot could save me.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT responded by gently informing me that there are more than two categories of food in existence. This was not something I was emotionally prepared to hear. I had built my entire understanding of stomach pain around the idea that removing dairy and gluten would make me invincible. Instead, I learned that the universe contains things like acidic foods, high fiber vegetables, cold brew on an empty stomach, stress, fried food, late meals, and the chaotic act of eating too quickly. At one point, I genuinely wondered if ChatGPT was suggesting that being alive was the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I recovered from the shock, I started interrogating myself like I was in a crime thriller. Did I eat something acidic yesterday. Maybe. Did I shovel a bowl of raw vegetables into my mouth because I wanted to feel virtuous. Possibly. Did I drink iced coffee before eating anything solid because I have the nutritional discipline of a small woodland creature. Absolutely. Did I inhale lunch in under five minutes because I had back to back meetings. I cannot confirm or deny.\n",
