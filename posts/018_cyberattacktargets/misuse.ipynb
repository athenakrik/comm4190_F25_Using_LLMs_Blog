    "“ChatGPT, how did thirty major organizations get hacked without anyone noticing?”\n",
    "\n",
    "That was the question I typed in after reading Anthropic’s disclosure. Their report quietly referenced more than thirty global organizations across industries like tech, finance, chemical manufacturing, and government. None were named. No victim statements, no public admissions, not even rumors strong enough to point to specific companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirty is not random.\n",
    "Thirty is systemic.\n",
    "Thirty means something foundational broke.\n",
    "\n",
    "The part I couldn’t shake was this: these organizations aren’t small. They aren’t under-resourced. These are companies with full security teams, formalized processes, and entire compliance departments dedicated to preventing exactly this kind of thing. So how did a coordinated, AI assisted breach slide past all of them?\n",
    "\n",
    "When I asked ChatGPT, the answer came back with an uncomfortable clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything comes down to GRC — Governance, Risk, and Compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "GRC is supposed to be the guardrail system of enterprise security. It dictates how organizations review permissions, evaluate risk, assess vendors, track vulnerabilities, and report compliance to regulators. In theory, it keeps companies protected and accountable. But in practice, GRC processes move at a pace that made sense decades ago, long before AI accelerated the threat landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional GRC operates at human speed. AI enabled intrusions happen at machine speed. That mismatch is the core weakness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compliance processes are periodic. Reviews happen quarterly or annually. Vulnerability assessments get logged, triaged, and revisited over long cycles. Policy attestations are checked off once a year. Dashboards get updated just often enough to satisfy auditors. Entire workflows depend on meetings, documentation updates, approvals, and versioning cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attackers no longer operate on that timeline. AI agents don’t wait for your next audit cycle. They don’t shut off at 5 PM. They don’t get overwhelmed by alerts or forget to follow up on a suspicious log entry. They can scan entire environments in minutes, reason through obstacles, pivot strategies instantly, mimic user behavior with precision, and quietly exfiltrate data while defenders are still planning their next quarterly review.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the insight that reframed everything for me. The thirty-plus victims weren’t negligent. Their systems were simply built for a slower era — an era where intrusions unfolded over days or weeks, and mitigation depended on human analysts catching signals manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI changes the tempo entirely. When an agent can run thousands of micro-actions simultaneously, traditional GRC becomes obsolete the moment an attack begins. Human speed cannot compete with machine speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why enterprises will need an entirely new generation of cybersecurity tools: systems that are built to operate continuously, interpret behavior in real time, and respond autonomously. AI native defense isn’t optional anymore; it’s the only viable path in a world where attackers are no longer bounded by human limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "What started as a simple question to ChatGPT became something much bigger: a realization that the core frameworks enterprises rely on were designed for a world that no longer exists. The next chapter of cybersecurity will belong to systems that can match the intelligence, speed, and adaptiveness of the agents now being used against us."
