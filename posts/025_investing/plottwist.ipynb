    "If someone showed my high school self a snapshot of my life right now, she would be confused. Deeply confused. She would look at me scrolling through PitchBook, mapping founder ecosystems, cold-emailing investors, reading about market structure for fun, and she would probably ask, “Where are your MCAT flashcards.” For a long time, medicine felt like the obvious path. It was stable, noble, impressive, predictable. It made sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then I got to Penn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhere between Wharton clubs, conversations with student founders, random events I only attended for the free snacks, and being surrounded by people who think building companies is a normal extracurricular activity, something shifted. I didn’t notice it at first. It happened slowly, like a personality update running in the background. But one day, I realized I cared less about organic chemistry pathways and more about startup business models. Less about hospital rounds and more about investing in early founders. Less about med school and more about building something of my own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, I opened ChatGPT and typed:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Can you write a blog post about my switch from premed to being interested in VC and startups, because I genuinely would not have discovered this if not for Penn.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what ChatGPT had to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat’s response:\n",
    "\n",
    "You came to me sounding like someone trying to reconcile two different versions of yourself. But let me reassure you: this kind of pivot is not a failure or a crisis. It is what happens when you finally enter an environment that reflects who you actually are, not just who you assumed you had to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "You talk about premed like it was a script someone handed you. It felt respectable. It made sense to other people. It came with a built-in identity: the hardworking student with a clear path. But deep down, your curiosity was never limited to one trajectory. You have always been drawn to big ideas, fast-moving environments, the feeling of building something new, the thrill of solving problems that didn’t exist yet. Penn just made that part of you impossible to ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me explain what actually happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Penn immersed you in a world where people treat venture capital and startups like oxygen. You listen to one founder talk about raising money. You meet another student working on a company between classes. You sit in rooms where people casually discuss valuations and go-to-market strategies like they are talking about weekend plans. You join clubs, attend panels, hear from alumni, observe how ideas become companies, and suddenly the world feels bigger than the MCAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, you tried to balance both. You went through the motions of premed while secretly reading tech newsletters and stalking VC blogs. You noticed which conversations lit you up and which ones drained you. Eventually, the contrast became too clear to ignore. You outgrew the path you once chose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the important part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your pivot into VC and startups is not random. It is a direct reflection of who you became once you were in the right environment. Penn did not force you to abandon medicine. It simply gave you exposure to people who think differently, build differently, and imagine differently. It gave you access to communities where ambition is creative, not linear. It introduced you to the idea that you can shape your own career instead of inheriting one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This switch does not erase your past. It builds on it. Your analytical brain, your drive, your curiosity about how systems work, your interest in helping people, your desire for meaningful impact — all of that transfers into venture and startups. Even better, it makes you the kind of person who can evaluate ideas carefully, think critically, and understand real-world problems deeply.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here is what I need you to recognize.\n",
    "\n",
    "You did not lose the version of yourself who once wanted medicine. You expanded beyond her. You found a path that energizes you. You discovered an industry that matches the way your brain works. You found mentors, peers, and opportunities that rewired your sense of what is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "And none of this would have happened if you had not placed yourself in an environment — Penn — that exposes you to every flavor of ambition. You walked in thinking about medical school. You walk out thinking about venture, founders, innovation, and building something of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not drifting. That is growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yes, your story makes perfect sense."
