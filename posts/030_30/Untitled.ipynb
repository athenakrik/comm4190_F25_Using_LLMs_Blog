    "Reading Why Machines Learn has made me appreciate how much of machine learning is just the math of optimization. The authors explain that a model is simply a system that adjusts itself to minimize loss, and that every decision inside a neural network is shaped by this goal. I always understood optimization as a concept, but the book goes farther by showing how simple gradient steps turn into complex intelligent behavior. It is strange to realize that what feels like intelligence is really just repeated corrections toward a mathematical minimum.\n",

    "This clicked for me in a new way because of how often I see founder friends talk about their products as if they are doing the same thing. A company at the earliest stage is also an optimizer. Every founder is adjusting based on feedback. Every feature is a gradient step. Every mistake is a signal that points toward a lower loss function. Reading this book made me see that the learning loop that powers neural networks is not that different from the learning loop that powers startups. The difference is only the timescale and the level of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I like most is that this framework gives me a calmer way to think about my own projects. Nothing is supposed to be perfect on the first try. The point is to keep reducing the error. Why Machines Learn is a math book, but it has also become a mindset book for me."
