    "We’ve Worried About AI Turning on Us — But Not Enough About Humans Using AI To Hurt Others\n",
    "\n",
    "“ChatGPT, can you explain this cybersecurity thing to me?”\n",
    "\n",
    "That was literally the prompt that started this entire spiral. I asked ChatGPT one simple question because I felt like I was missing something. Everyone on X had been panicking about Anthropic’s new agentic-attack disclosure, but I wasn’t convinced I understood the right frame for thinking about AI risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I typed the question in — fully expecting a surface-level explanation — and what I got back reframed the entire conversation for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "For years, the loudest public debates around AI have centered on one fear:\n",
    "\n",
    "“What if AI becomes autonomous and turns against humans?”\n",
    "\n",
    "It's dramatic. It's cinematic. It’s the kind of narrative Hollywood and philosophy papers both love. But when you ask, “What’s actually happening today?” you get a very different answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic’s report makes something extremely clear:\n",
    "The immediate risk isn’t AI turning against us.\n",
    "It’s humans weaponizing AI long before AI becomes anything close to autonomous.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attack Anthropic documented wasn’t the model deciding to behave maliciously; it wasn’t “AI gone rogue.” It was a clever human operator realizing that an AI coding agent can now:\n",
    "\n",
    "write, test, and deploy code instantly\n",
    "\n",
    "perform multi-step reasoning that used to require high-skill engineers\n",
    "\n",
    "follow long-running plans without losing context\n",
    "\n",
    "scrape, scan, and exploit systems at a speed that no human can match\n",
    "\n",
    "That last point is the real unlock.\n",
    "AI doesn’t need consciousness to be dangerous — it just needs speed, scale, and automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you give a motivated attacker access to an agent that can coordinate thousands of operations per second, execute tasks in parallel, and adapt its approach dynamically, you’ve essentially given them the equivalent of an automated cyber operations team.\n",
    "\n",
    "And suddenly the entire defensive conversation flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because if attackers now have autonomous agents that can think, iterate, and execute at machine speed…\n",
    "defenders must also have agents that can detect, interpret, and counteract attacks at machine speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the part that hit me hardest when ChatGPT broke it down:\n",
    "We are no longer in a world where cybersecurity is a human vs. human problem.\n",
    "We are entering a world of AI agents vs. AI agents, each racing to out-reason and out-maneuver the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next decade of cybersecurity won’t be defined by firewalls or compliance checklists.\n",
    "It will be defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- autonomous defensive systems\n",
    "- continuous monitoring\n",
    "- anomaly-detection agents\n",
    "- real-time reasoning engines\n",
    "- automated incident response\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "a full-blown arms race between attacker agents and defender agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "What stuck with me after prompting ChatGPT was this simple idea:\n",
    "We’ve been preparing for speculative risks — the “superintelligence” movies, the runaway-AI memes — but the real shift is already here, quietly unfolding through human actors who understand how to harness AI as a force multiplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The danger is not AI turning evil.\n",
    "The danger is humans turning AI into a weapon.\n",
    "\n",
    "And once you see that, you can’t unsee it."
