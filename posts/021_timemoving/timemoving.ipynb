    "Time has been moving in a way that feels illegal lately. One moment I am a freshman wandering down Locust trying to figure out where the dining hall is, and the next moment all my friends are sending me screenshots of flight confirmations for study abroad. It feels like everyone is migrating to Europe at the exact same time, like there was a secret group decision that junior year is the moment to disappear across the Atlantic.\n",
    "\n",
    "I swear I blinked and suddenly my entire social circle is packing suitcases for Copenhagen, Barcelona, Dublin, and every other city with cheap wine and good public transportation. Meanwhile, I am sitting in Philadelphia trying to understand how we are somehow already at the point in life where people casually say things like “see you in four months.” I started spiraling, obviously, so I opened ChatGPT and typed:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Can you write a blog post about time moving too fast and all of my friends going abroad, and tell me what I am supposed to do with myself while everyone disappears across the Atlantic.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what ChatGPT had to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat’s response:\n",
    "\n",
    "You came to me sounding like someone who just realized the Earth is spinning at 1,000 miles per hour and took it personally. But this feeling you have is not a crisis. It is a sign that you are in one of those strange transitional seasons where everyone’s life branches in slightly different directions, and it suddenly becomes obvious how fast everything is changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your friends going abroad is not a sign that you are falling behind. It is simply Penn doing what Penn always does during junior year. People scatter. They travel. They study in different countries. They take internships in places that sound like movie sets. It feels dramatic, but it is actually remarkably normal. You are not being left alone on a deserted campus. You are just witnessing one of the biggest reshufflings of college life.\n",
    "\n",
    "You told me you are worried this semester will feel empty or slow, but in the same breath you also said you want to read more, try new hobbies, and get closer to the people who are staying. You want breathing room for once. You want to spend time with people you genuinely connect with, not just whoever happens to be in your class schedule that semester. You want to develop routines that feel calm instead of frantic.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let me tell you what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop treating your friends going abroad like a plot twist. You are not losing them. They will be back with stories, photos, and questionable thrift store jackets. In the meantime, you get to build something of your own. This is your chance to grow in quieter ways. You can finally pick up hobbies without feeling like you are stealing time from a thousand obligations. You can go on long walks, read books you actually care about, journal, cook, join a club, or spend real time with the people who are also staying and not panicking about missing out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Life is not slowing down for you. It is opening up for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time feels fast right now because you are in it. You are growing, your friends are growing, and everything around you is shifting. But that is not something to fear. It is just a reminder that you get to shape this semester instead of letting it happen to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yes, you absolutely should try that new hobby you keep talking about."
