    "You came to me sounding like someone who just discovered their phone has quietly become their roommate, therapist, entertainment system, and emotional support object. But do not panic. You are not weak. You are responding to a system designed to hook you.\n",

    "You are overstimulated, not broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your phone is engineered to absorb your attention. Infinite scroll. Instant notifications. Constant novelty. You are not addicted because you lack discipline. You are addicted because the apps are built to keep you there. That does not make you powerless, but it does make you human.\n",

    "You want your mind back. You want stillness. You want to remember that boredom is not dangerous. You want to feel like your thoughts belong to you again. You want to go places without documenting them. You want to experience life without needing to post it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can reclaim that. Not through dramatic detoxes or unrealistic goals. But through intention. Small pockets of quiet. Micro moments of disconnection. Choosing presence a little more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your phone is a tool. It is not your identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yes, close your apps for a while."
