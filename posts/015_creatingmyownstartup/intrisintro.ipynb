    "What Is Intris? A Newsletter for People Who Want to Understand the Future, Not Just Watch It Happen\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve ever tried to keep up with AI, you know the feeling: every week brings a new breakthrough, a new startup, a new “paradigm shift.” The pace is overwhelming, and most coverage either oversimplifies the real story or inflates it with hype.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intris exists to fix that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intris is a biweekly newsletter designed for people who want to understand the world that AI is creating. Each edition has two anchors:\n",
    "\n",
    "A sharp, opinion-driven deep dive on a major development in AI or emerging technology, and\n",
    "\n",
    "A founder spotlight highlighting young builders who are quietly shaping the next wave of innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure gives readers a full view of the landscape. You get the big idea and the real humans behind it. Not just theory, but action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Intris Is Different\n",
    "\n",
    "Most tech newsletters either focus on headlines or go so deep that only researchers can follow. Intris sits in the middle: analytical but accessible, ambitious but readable. It’s the kind of publication you can digest in one sitting but think about for days.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes Intris interesting isn’t just the content—it’s the perspective. The essays challenge assumptions, break down complex systems, and call out trends that actually matter instead of chasing hype. They’re written with the mindset of someone who studies AI, works in tech, and talks daily with founders and investors. That combination is rare, and it shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, the founder spotlights bring forward the type of people who will be on magazine covers five years from now but aren’t there yet. These are student founders, early operators, young technical builders with ideas that feel like they belong in the future. By highlighting their stories early, Intris plugs readers into the next generation before everyone else notices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who Should Read Intris\n",
    "\n",
    "Intris is for anyone who wants to think more clearly about technology:\n",
    "\n",
    "Student founders who want a pulse on emerging markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aspiring VCs who want to see patterns early.\n",
    "\n",
    "Builders and operators who want context, not noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Curious readers who want to understand why AI is changing everything, not just how.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re the type of person who follows frontier companies, has strong opinions about where tech is headed, or feels excited by the idea of being early to the next big shift, then Intris was built for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, Intris isn’t just a newsletter. It’s an observation deck for the future. It exists to make complexity understandable, to give a platform to the people building what comes next, and to help readers see around corners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the future doesn’t wait. But with the right lens, you can understand it long before it arrives."
