    "“Write a post that connects the book’s ideas about statistical learning to the broader fear of machine intelligence, and add my personal take on why people misunderstand what models are actually doing.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Blog post:\n",
    "The book ends with a quiet argument that I think more people should internalize. Machine learning is not a mystical leap in intelligence. It is a statistical system designed to reduce predictive error over time. The authors break down the mathematics in a way that strips away the narratives of sentience and looming machine takeover. When you understand the mechanics, the fear feels misplaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "This resonated with me because I spend so much time reading online discussions about AI. A lot of the panic comes from imagining that models have goals or intentions. Why Machines Learn makes it clear that they do not. They only follow gradients. They only adjust weights. They only minimize loss. That is powerful, but it is not the same thing as having agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "My personal take is that misunderstanding comes from the surface behavior. When you see fluent language or convincing reasoning, it is easy to anthropomorphize. But the book reminded me that human intelligence and machine intelligence operate on different foundations. One is built on neurons and experience. The other is built on optimization and mathematical structure. Recognizing that difference helps cut through the noise in AI discourse."
